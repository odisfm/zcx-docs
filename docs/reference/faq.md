# frequently asked questions

### What's all this then?

Have a look at the [Github page for zcx-core](https://github.com/odisfm/zcx-core).

### Does zcx replace ClyphX?

Nope. While technically the script will run without ClyphX, it requires ClyphX running to do anything useful, i.e. trigger actions.

### Does zcx replace X-controls and G-controls

That's up to you. zcx can be used to create a far more complex interface than is possible with native ClyphX. However, that power comes with a learning curve. Only you can decide whether this tradeoff is worth it.

### What hardware is zcx available for?

[See here.](/docs/lessons/installation.md#get-a-distribution)

### Can I use zcx with a non-matrix controller?

zcx is designed for matrix-equipped controllers. You could make a port for your hardware, and just not use the matrix features. That's up to you. Remember: each zcx script requires its own control surface slot.

### How do I port zcx to my hardware?

See the [porting guide.](/docs/other/404.md)

### Is there a Discord?

[But of course.
